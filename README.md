## Sampling Techniques

### Systematic Sampling
Systematic sampling involves selecting every nth item from the dataset after an initial random starting point. It provides a structured and unbiased way to create subsets of data.

### Random Sampling
Random sampling involves randomly selecting data points from the dataset. It ensures each data point has an equal chance of being included, providing a fair representation of the overall dataset.

### Stratified Sampling
Stratified sampling divides the dataset into subgroups or strata based on specific characteristics. Random sampling is then performed within each stratum to create representative subsets for each group.

### Cluster Sampling
Cluster sampling involves dividing the dataset into clusters or groups. Randomly selected clusters are then sampled in their entirety, making it useful for large datasets with natural groupings.
